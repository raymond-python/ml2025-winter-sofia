Mod 4 Task:

The program asks the user for input N (positive integer) and reads it
Then the program asks the user to provide N numbers (one by one) and reads all of them (again, one by one)
In the end, the program asks the user for input X (integer) and outputs: "-1" if there were no such X among N read numbers, or the index (from 1 to N) of this X if the user inputed it before.

1. Create a Python program:
The program asks the user for input N (positive integer) and reads i
Then the program asks the user to provide N numbers (one by one) and reads all of them (again, one by one)
In the end, the program asks the user for input X (integer) and outputs: "-1" if there were no such X among N read numbers, or the index (from 1 to N) of this X if the user inputted it before.
The basic functionality of data processing (data initialization, data insertion, data search) should be done via Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm (i.e. using Classes)
Name this program "module5_oop.py" and upload it to the above-mentioned repo.

2. Create the functionality outside of the main running code: i.e., create the module with the Class described in the item above, and name this module "module5_mod.py" + create the main program "module5_call.py" that uses the Class description from the "*_mod" file.  Upload everything to the above-mentioned repo.

Create a Python program:
The program asks the user for input N (positive integer) and reads it.
Then the program asks the user for input k (positive integer) and reads it.
Then the program asks the user to provide N (x, y) points (one by one) and reads all of them: first: x value, then: y value for every point one by one. X and Y are the real numbers.
In the end, the program asks the user for input X and outputs: the result (Y) of k-NN Regression if k <= N, or any error message otherwise.
The basic functionality of data processing (data initialization, data insertion, data calculation) should be done using Numpy library as much as possible (note: you can combine with OOP from the previous task).
Name this program "module6_knn-regr.py" and upload it to the above-mentioned repo.

1. Create a Python program:
The program asks the user for input N (positive integer) and reads it.
Then the program asks the user for input k (positive integer) and reads it.
Then the program asks the user to provide N (x, y) points (one by one) and reads all of them: first: x value, then: y value for every point one by one. X and Y are the real numbers.
In the end, the program asks the user for input X and outputs: the result (Y) of k-NN Regression if k <= N, or any error message otherwise.
Additionally, provide the variance of labels in the training dataset.
The basic functionality of data processing (data initialization, data insertion), should be done using Numpy library while the computation (ML) part should be done using Scikit-learn library as much as possible (note: you can combine with what you've done from the previous task).

Name this program "module7_knn-regr-scikit.py" and upload it to the above-mentioned repo.
